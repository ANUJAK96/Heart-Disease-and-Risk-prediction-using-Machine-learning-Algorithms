# Heart-Disease-and-Risk-prediction-using-Machine-learning-Algorithms
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the residents of the city of Framingham, Massachusetts to determine the factors affecting heart disease. • Built different predictive models using K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Random forests, Decesion trees, SVM classification and Gradient Boosting regression. • Gradient Boosting regressions performance was best with an accuracy of 76% and (M.S.E) 10.14. • Finally, predicted, and classified future diagnostic values.
